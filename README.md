# DoA Estimation using optimized MUSIC Algorithm
This repository includes the code in Vivado 2016.3 as used for the paper:

Uzma M. Butt, Shoab A. Khan, Anees Ullah, Abdul Khaliq, Pedro Reviriego, Ali Zahir "Towards Low Latency and Resource-Efficient FPGAImplementations of the MUSIC Algorithm forDirection of Arrival Estimation", under review in IEEE Transactions on Circuit and Systems I.

# Dependencies

Vivado 2016.3

# Content
*src* directory includes the following files:
- 
- MUSIC_rep_DA_I.tcl (vivado project for Design Approach I)
- 
- MUSIC_rep_DA_II.tcl (vivado project for Design Approach II)
- 


# Execution of the code
- 
-	Open the *.tcl file in Vivado 2016.3
-	Execute the synthesis and implementation for Resources utilization, timing response and power consumption analysis
-	Run Simulation to see the output 

# Results
-	The resources utilized by the algorithm can be evaluated from MUSIC_repo_DA_I.tcl and MUSIC_repo_DA_II.tcl for DA-I and DA-II respectively.
